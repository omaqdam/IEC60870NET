# TODO

- Review outstanding telemetry types for inclusion in codec registry.
- Harden Security module with certificate rotation and policy validation.
- Build deployment packaging (MSIX/service installers) once interop completes.

# Project Next Steps

1. Broaden codec coverage (double commands, time-tagged monitors, etc.).
2. Flesh out IEC 101 framing/serial transport.
3. Add automated interop harnesses or golden PCAP replay under 	ests/IEC60870.InteropTests.
